**definition of Machine Learning according to Arthur Samuel**
Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed"

**definition of Machine Learning according to Tom Mitchell**
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

**Example for Machine Learning according to Tom Mitchell**
 If I want a program to predict traffic patterns (task T), can run it through a machine learning algorithm with data about past traffic patterns (experience E) and, if it has successfully “learned”, it will then do better at predicting future traffic patterns (performance measure P).
